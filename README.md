Problem definition and background

University of Regina (U of R) students have many responsibilities. One example is
the responsibility of purchasing a textbook or book for a specific class. However, acquiring a
textbook has become a problem and/or annoyance for many students. For the reasons below,
textbooks and/or books required for specific classes often become a problem and/or annoyance
because:
 They become out of date really quickly
 They are expensive
 They are considered an extra unnecessary cost
In addition, there have been times when the U of R Bookstore is out of a specific
book and students must turn to other places to acquire it. This leads to students needing to
order a book to their house, purchase online in a PDF form or purchase at another physical
store. Hence, this brings this report to the first very large problem that uBooks will be solving.
uBooks will provide an easy route to search and purchase books required for University classes.
A second example of a student responsibility is the selling of textbooks or books. For the
reasons below, selling used books required for specific classes often becomes a problem and
annoyance because:
 Selling books is considered a hassle
 Some students do not even know that the U of R Buy Back program exists
 The BuyBack program only occurs several days a year
 BuyBack program only offers a 50 percent offer on used or new prices
 BuyBack program is not always able to buy back your books
 U of R Book Store website has a very limited functionality
 U of R Book Store does not provide an appealing and user-friendly interface
 U of R Book Store does not provide an advanced search functionality
 Selling through Facebook Textbook Buy and Sell group is not user friendly
In addition, there is a lot of time that goes into selling or searching for specific books
within the Facebook Textbook Buy and Sell groups. It requires hours of scrolling looking for
potential sellers and/or buyers. Hence, this brings this report to the second very large problem
that uBooks will be solving. uBooks will provide an easy route to sell books under title, author,
edition, year and other classifications.

1.2 Motivations
As students ourselves, we wanted to come up with an application that solves our
textbook buying and selling problems and helps thousands of others at the same university.
We simply do not have this type of application being used or considered by students. The U of
R Book Store website does not provide students with the ability to sell their own books. The
Buy Back program that happens twice a year is only done at the physical store, which creates
an inconvenience and a long line up. Moreover, the university does not facilitate students who
want to sell their books to other students, and not the university.
In our new web application uBooks, we aim to provide the university students with the ability
to buy and sell books anywhere at any time. Also, this will allow students to sell books for a
reasonably higher price opposed to the fixed price that the university offers. As for students
who want to buy textbooks, they will be able to buy the books for a cheaper price than at the
university bookstore.
U of R Book Store website does not have an advanced search feature that allows students
to search a book by title, genre, year, etc. With the large number of books for sale, it can get
very frustrating for a student to find a book they want. To alleviate this problem, we have
implemented an extensive search functionality that enables students to find the desired book
with ease.
Judging by the poor and unresponsive interface and the limited functionality of the U of
R Book Store website, we can conclude that it has been built using some old development
technology. Poorly designed user interface creates a big inconvenience for the students and
impacts the user experience with the website. In our new web application, we aim to provide
exceptional user interface and a reasonably good user experience.
Mykytaâ€™s personal motivation is to build a much better web application than the U of R
Book Store. The newly built application must provide an advanced search functionality and
allow students to easily sell their own books. Moreover, the interface must be well designed to
provide a pleasant user experience.
Breaâ€™s personal motivation is that she has over a dozen textbooks simply sitting at home
because selling them is a hassle that she does not have time for. If we can help students like
ourselves sell textbooks with ease and get some of their hard earned money back into their
pockets, that is our motivation goal.
